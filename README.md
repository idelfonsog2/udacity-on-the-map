# On The Map

The On The Map app allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing students to place themselves “on the map,” so to speak.

## Software required:
- Xcode 8.0 +
- Swift 3.0 +

## Installation:
In terminal run:
```
git clone https://github.com/idelfonsog2/udacity-on-the-map.git
cd udacity-on-the-map
open udacity-on-the-map.xcodeproj
```

change the bundle Id if necessary

## Issues:

The information button in the annotations won't work unless the user has input an **https://**  in their profile
